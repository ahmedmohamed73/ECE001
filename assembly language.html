    An assembly language is a low-level programming language designed for a specific type of processor. It may be produced by compiling source code from a high-level programming language (such as C/C++) but can also be written from scratch. Assembly code can be converted to machine code using an assembler.
    
    </p>
    <p>
    Since most compilers convert source code directly to machine code, software developers often create programs without using assembly language. However, in some cases, assembly code can be used to fine-tune a program. For example, a programmer may write a specific process in assembly language to make sure it functions as efficiently as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
    While assembly languages differ between processor architectures, they often include similar instructions and operators. Below are some examples of instructions supported by x86 processors.    
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
        MOV - move data from one location to another
                </li>
        <li>
            ADD - add two values

        </li>
        <li>
        SUB - subtract a value from another value

        </li>
    <li>
        PUSH - push data onto a stack
        </li>
        <li>
        POP - pop data from a stack
        </li>
        <li>
        JMP - jump to another location

        </li>
        <li>
        INT - interrupt a process

        </li>
    </ul>
        <h2> 
            The following assembly language can be used to add the numbers 3 and 4:
        </h2>
        <p>
        mov eax, 3 - loads 3 into the register "eax"
<br>
            mov ebx, 4 - loads 4 into the register "ebx"
<br>
            add eax, ebx, ecx - adds "eax" and "ebx" and stores the result (7) in "ecx"
        
        </p>
    <p>   Writing assembly language is a tedious process since each operation must be performed at a very basic level. While it may not be necessary to use assembly code to create a computer program, learning assembly language is often part of a Computer Science curriculum since it provides useful insight into the way processors work.

    <h3>
    Difference between Machine Language and Assembly Language

    </h3>
    <p>
    Programming languages are used for creating instructions to make computers perform specific tasks. These languages can be categorized as machine language, high-level programming language, and assembly language. 

    </p>
    
        <p>
        Through this article, we aim to make our readers gain more knowledge about the definitions of machine language and assembly language, the difference between assembly language and machine language, and their key features and functionality.

        What is Machine Language?
        </h4>
        <p>
            The <b>machine language </b>definition states that for computers to understand the commands provided in high-level languages like Java, C, C++, Python, the instructions have to be given in machine language that comprises of bits. The conversion of a high-level language to machine language takes place by using an interpreter or compiler.

        <ul type="square">
        <li>
            Machine language comprises of zeros and ones. As computers are in the form of digital electronic devices, they use these binary digits for their operations.

            <li>
            In machine language, one showcases the true or on state while zero depicts the false or off state.
