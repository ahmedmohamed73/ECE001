        A high-level language (HLL) is a programming language such as C, FORTRAN, or Pascal that enables a programmer to write programs that are more or less independent of a particular type of computer. Such languages are considered high-level because they are closer to human languages and further from <a href="assembly%20language.html"> machine languages</a> .
    
    </p>
    <p>
    
    In contrast, assembly languages are considered low-level because they are very close to machine languages.

    <h2>Advantages of High-Level Languages
</h2>
<p>
    The main advantage of high-level languages over low-level languages is that they are easier to read, write, and maintain. Ultimately, programs written in a high-level language must be translated into machine language by a compiler or interpreter.

</p>    
    <p>
    The first high-level programming languages were designed in the 1950s. Now there are dozens of different languages, including Ada, Algol, BASIC, COBOL, C, C++, FORTRAN, LISP, Pascal, and Prolog.

        At the end of the statement if you miss semicolon it throws an error.
<br>
            In Java you must define particular block using curly braces without it code won’t work.	
        
        </td>
        <td style="text-align: center">
        In python, statement do not need a semicolon to end.
<br>
            In python, you have never seen a sight of curly braces but indentation is mandatory in python. Indentation also improves readability of code.

        <td style="text-align: center">
        Python codes are dynamic typed. This means that you don’t need to declare a type of the variable this is known as duck typing.

        <td style="text-align: center">
        It is slower because python is an interpreter and also it determines the type of data at runtime.

        </td>
        <td style="text-align: center">
        Java is not easy to use as compared to python because there is no dynamic programming concept and codes are longer than python.	        
        </td>
        <td style="text-align: center">Python codes are shorter than java. python follows dynamic programming python codes not only easy to use but also easy to understand because of indentation.

        Java enjoys more undeviating refactoring support than python thanks to its static type system and universality of IDE’s in development.

        <td style="text-align: center">
        Java’s history in the enterprise and its slightly more verbose coding style mean that Java legacy systems are typically larger and more numerous than python’s.	
        </td>
        <td style="text-align: center">
        Python has less legacy problem so organization finds difficulty for the script to copy and paste codes.
